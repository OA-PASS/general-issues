## Contributing to PASS

### Kicking the Tires

Thanks for looking at PASS! Whether you are interested in simply improving the existing code base, or maybe even thinking about forking the project for use at your institution, it's a good idea to have a look at a running test instance and exercising the workflows. The easiest way to do this is to simply check out our [demo instance](https://demo.eclipse-pass.org/ ).

### Bug Fixing

There is always a need for fixing bugs, and we are continually looking at adding new features. Contributions furthering these efforts are always welcome. It may be that you simply notice something that doesn't seem to work quite right. If so, you can check the GitHub issues to see if a ticket has already been filed. If so, you might comment on the issue if you have new information which might be helpful. If there is no existing issue, you might consider creating one. The same process holds for exploring the addition of a new feature.

If you are creating a ticket, it will be very helpful if you can give a concise description of the issue - and for a bug, especially the steps needed to reproduce it, and how the bad behavior is displayed to the user. It is also important to give details about your environment - OS, build environment (Java and maven versions) etc.

### Digging Deeper

If you are ready to contribute to the code base, you will need an account on GitHub.  Further, since PASS is an Eclipse Foundation project, contributors will need to create an Eclipse account and sign a [contributor agreement](https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/eca). To keep things simple, the email address you use to sign up for the Eclipse account should be the same as the one you use for your GitHub account.

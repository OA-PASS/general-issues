# Eclipse Public Access Submission System (PASS) ![Pass Main](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main/actions/workflows/pass-complete-release.yml/badge.svg)

The Public Access Submission System (PASS) is a comprehensive platform designed to help researchers comply with the 
access policies mandated by their funders and institutions.

Navigating the complex landscape of public access requirements can be challenging, as policies vary significantly across
federal agencies, each with its own unique compliance process. These differing requirements often place an
administrative burden on researchers and institutions, particularly when research is funded by multiple agencies, making
compliance a complex and time-consuming task.

In addition, many universities have adopted their own open access policies, which further mandate that research outputs
be publicly accessible. This overlap means that a single publication can fall under multiple policies, each with
distinct workflows and submission criteria. PASS simplifies this process by consolidating and streamlining the
submission workflows, enabling researchers to efficiently meet the diverse compliance requirements.

# Documentation

All documentation should be written within this [main repo](https://github.com/eclipse-pass/main),
or referenced here.  For example, please include links (with a small description) to
any relevant websites, external references, and other cloud storages (e.g. Google Docs).

* [Developer documentation](/docs/development.md)
* [Deployment documentation](/docs/deployment.md)
* [User documentation](/docs/user.md)
* [Working with GitHub secrets](/docs/infrastructure/github-secrets.md)

*Please remove the `.gitkeep` files as documentation pages are added to the currently empty directories.*

Learn more about the [PASS Architecture](/docs/architecture.md) and [code delivery pipeline](/docs/deploy/pipeline.md) as we go from
source code to deployed application.

# Bitwarden

A [password tool](https://bitwarden.com) to help us manage our [organizations secrets](https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/vault?organizationId=e429b264-5b49-4794-be50-b0660125456a).

Here is an outline of passwords we are tracking
(duplicating here as can better document the integrations with other services
like [Otterdog](/docs/infra/otterdog.md) and Github Actions).
